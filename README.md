# EL Image Efficiency Agent
A powerful Streamlit application for analyzing solar cell Electroluminescence (EL) images using machine learning and large language models. Classify efficiency levels, predict Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE), and get AI-powered insights about your solar cell quality.

# Features
**🖼️ EL Image Analysis: Upload multiple solar cell EL images for batch processing
**📊 Efficiency Classification: Automatically classify images as High/Low efficiency using ResNet features
**🔬 PCE Prediction: Predict Power Conversion Efficiency for high-efficiency cells
**🤖 AI-Powered Insights: Get detailed technical analysis using LLM (Local or SJTU API)
**💬 Interactive Chat: Ask questions about your specific analysis results
**📈 Batch Reporting: Generate comprehensive batch quality assessments
**📥 Data Export: Download results as CSV for further analysis

# Quick Start
## Prerequisites
**Python 3.12
**4GB+ RAM
**2GB+ free disk space

# Installation
## 1. Clone the repository
**git clone https://github.com/mahreenahmed/gcl.git
**cd el-agent-app

## 2. Create virtual environment (recommended)
**python -m venv el_env
**source el_env/bin/activate
**On Windows: 
**el_env\Scripts\activate

## 3. Install dependencies
**pip install -r requirements.txt

## 4. Download model files
**Place the following files in the models/ directory:
** best_classifier.onnx
** weighted_random_forest_model.pkl
** feature_scaler.pkl

## 5. Running the Application
**streamlit run el_agent_app.py
**The app will open in your browser at http://localhost:8501

# Usage Guide
## Step 1: Upload EL Images
**Click "Upload EL images" button
**Select multiple PNG/JPG/JPEG files
**Supported: Standard EL images of solar cells

## Step 2: Run Analysis
**Click "Classify & Summarize Batch"
**Wait for processing (typically 2-10 seconds per image)
**View efficiency classifications and PCE predictions

## Step 3: Get AI Insights
**Use pre-built analysis buttons:
**Defect Analysis: Identify issues in low-efficiency cells
**PCE Analysis: Evaluate performance metrics
**Batch Summary: Comprehensive quality report
**Next Steps: Practical recommendations

## Step 4: Ask Custom Questions
**Type specific questions in the chat interface
**Examples:
***"Which images show cracking patterns?"
***"Compare high vs low efficiency cells"
***"What could cause the dark areas in image3.jpg?"

# Understanding Results
## Efficiency Classification
**🔆 High Efficiency: Uniform, bright luminescence (good quality)
**⚠️ Low Efficiency: Dark areas, cracks, non-uniform patterns (defects)
## PCE Values
**10-18%: Good performance range
**<10%: Poor performance
** "—": Not calculated for low-efficiency cells

# Quality Indicators
**High batch efficiency ratio: Good manufacturing consistency
**Tight PCE distribution: Excellent process control
**Low defect rate: Robust cell quality

# Security & Privacy
**Encrypted API Keys: SJTU API keys are encrypted for security
**No Data Storage: Uploaded images are processed in memory only
**Session-based: Chat history clears when browser closes

# Troubleshooting
## Common Issues
**"Models not loaded" error
** Ensure model files are in models/ directory
**Check file permissions
**Verify ONNX runtime is installed
*"API connection failed"
** Check internet connection
**Verify SJTU campus network access
**Confirm API key is correctly encrypted
*"Image processing error"
** Ensure images are valid EL images
** Check image format (PNG/JPG/JPEG)
**Verify file size (<10MB recommended)
**Slow performance
**Close other memory-intensive applications
**Reduce number of simultaneous uploads
**Use local model mode for faster responses
**Performance Tips
**Batch size: Process 5-10 images at a time for optimal performance
**Image size: Resize large images (>5MB) before uploading
**Local mode: Use for faster results without advanced analysis
